## History

Like any other fan of Reactable, I was amazed with the [psychosynth](https://github.com/arximboldi/psychosynth) project years ago, but it seemed to not gain enough attraction.
And the Reactable Mobile application sure was very entertaining, but it misses the physical part of handling the controls with your hands and not your fingers. 

Also I don't have the money or space to keep that huge table in my house, but still I'd love to play it some time.

So while talking to a friend recently, we discussed that LLMs were a thing and nowadays are working good enough, I thought about what project could I try to make... And so this idea came to my mind.
